We're delighted to announce that beta 6 of Mu is here (get it from from
[the download page](https://codewith.mu/en/download))!

As always, since this is a beta release and may contain bugs or unfinished
features. Please provide bug reports or feedback via
[GitHub](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/new).

One of the characteristics of this release is that it contains contributions
from several folk who are not regular core members of the volunteer Mu
developers team. This is a healthy sign as it proves three things:

1. Folks see value in and care about Mu.
2. The Mu project itself is friendly and welcoming to new contributors.
3. Our codebase is small and simple enough that it's easy to make changes.

Many thanks to *everyone* who has contributed to this release. Your work is
really appreciated.

So, what's new?


* [Carlos](https://github.com/carlosperate) fixed some packaging problems
  relating to the iPython kernel bundled with Mu.
* [Martin](https://github.com/dybber) fixed a couple of problems relating to
  the stopping of child processes (Flask and scripts stopped via
  KeyboardInterrupt in Linux).
* The web mode checks for the availability of templates in the local directory
  tree before starting up. If a template directory isn't found in the expected
  location, then the user sees a helpful message describing the problem and
  what they need to do to fix it.
* Mu's splash screen no longer always appears on top of everything else on the
  user's desktop. The splash screen now also logs the progress of installing
  the various packages needed on first install. Thanks to Carlos for these
  changes.
* A new admin/settings option has been added to allow users to manually change
  the translation Mu uses for its interface. Updating this setting requires a
  restart of Mu. [Zander](https://github.com/ZanderBrown) contributed the
  icon/glyph to indicate the relevant tab is for translation related settings
  (not entirely obvious if Mu's UI is using a language you don't understand
  and you're looking for the setting that relates to translations). The icon
  makes this clear.
* On some desktop windowing systems there is a bug that means windows re-open
  at a position higher up the screen, and so may appear off the top of the
  screen. We've ensured this never happens with Mu. If Mu starts with any
  part of the window off the screen, the window is moved to be within the
  dimensions of the screen. This was a weird one to track down and fix.
* Many thanks to [Ethan Spoelstra](https://github.com/espoelstra) who
  contributed a change so Crostini on ChromeOS is used to return the correct
  CIRCUITPY path if it exists.
* Huge thanks to [Keith Packard](https://github.com/keith-packard) for several
  contributions to this release of Mu. Keith refactored the way in which Mu
  handles pasting in the REPL window so it works correctly and more broadly
  across operating systems.
* Keith also fixed some font related issues in the REPL.
* Keith was on fire with a couple more contributions relating to SVG icons in
  the buttons in Mu. We're very grateful to
  [Ben Williams](https://github.com/Rybec) for putting in the work to make our
  button icons SVG files. Keith made the code changes to implement this.
* Thanks to [Miro Hronƒçok](https://github.com/hroncok) for pointing out a
  change in Python 10 which would break some of our UI calls into PyQt, and
  who provided a patch to fix things.
* Some minor clarifications in our
  [developer documentation](https://mu.rtfd.io).

We're getting close to a 1.1.0-final, with some virtual environment fixes and
translation related work remaining to be done.

That's it..! :-)
