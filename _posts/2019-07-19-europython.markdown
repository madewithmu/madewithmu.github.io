Mu made a number of appearances at last week's wonderful
[EuroPython 2019](https://ep2019.europython.eu/)
conference in Basel, Switzerland. This is a report of what happened...

EuroPython is a famously friendly event, and well known for welcoming folks
who are new to the Python community. One of the most effective ways of achieving
this is the beginners' day, run during the tutorial sessions that preceed the
main conference. Many folks who have contributed to Mu volunteered their time
to organise the beginners' day and support those taking their first steps into
programming. The latest version of Mu was used as the development platform for
each of the activities that took place, and it was a huge relief to avoid 
spending the first hour helping folks download, install, configure and setup
Python and a code editor. Mu's bundled approach saved a huge amount of time!

The following photographs, taken by the talented [Gaetano Scognamiglio](https://www.flickr.com/groups/europython2019/pool/with/48247633712/),
give a flavour of the day.

Many thanks especially to Kassia, Dan and Tiago for leading, presenting and
planning several of the Mu based activities with which the beginners engaged.
By the end of the day they had created computer art with Python's `turtle`
module, made a simple website with Flask, used MicroPython to program some
BBC micro:bits (kindly donated by the
[micro:bit foundation](https://microbit.org/)) and made a cat game with
PyGameZero. The
afternoon was particularly good fun since the participants were encouraged to
let their creative juices flow and come up with simple coding projects of
their own.

These two videos capture the sorts of things folks got up to. First up is a
hilarious splat-a-cat game.

I particularly like how this participant made a mashup of micro:bit and
PyGameZero.

Members of the Mu community were also speaking at EuroPython.

Long time contributor, [Tiago](https://tmont.es/), gave a barn storming
performance of live coding in front of an appreciative audience, where he
created a simple arcade game using just Python's `turtle` module and a few
lines of code. What I particularly enjoyed about Tiago's talk was the way he
was able to tell the story of how the code is built up in simple
steps to create a rather compelling and entertaining game.

I (Nicholas) also gave a talk about how we go about developing Mu. This was a
story of the sorts of things we focus on, the technical choices that result and
the motivation that keeps us working on Mu.

Finally, at the end of the conference were "code sprints", where
developers got together to code with each on various different projects.
During this time Tiago was able to make quite a large number of issues, pull
requests and other contributions via Mu's [GitHub](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu)
repository. Hopefully these will make their way into the upcoming alpha 3
release of Mu.

All that remains is for me to thank the
[organisers of EuroPython](https://www.europython-society.org/)
for putting on such a well organised, relaxed, welcoming and community
focused conference.

I'm already looking forward to next year's edition.
