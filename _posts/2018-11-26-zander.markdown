Mu is not a solo effort. Many folks have [contributed to Mu](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/graphs/contributors),
and I will be eternally grateful for their work. With the spirit of
recognising the voluntary contributions of others in mind, I'm going to write
about some of our most prodigious programmers. First up is [Zander Brown](https://github.com/ZanderBrown).

Zander, like [Top Gear's the Stig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stig), is
a bit of a mystery.

Until recently, nobody had ever met him in real life, and all interactions with
Zander were via copious GitHub comments, pull requests and bug fixes.

Some said he was an alien being from another dimension, others claimed him to
be a rogue artificial intellegince running rampant in random Git repositories,
yet more people whispered in hushed tones that he was merely a pseudonym for
Bill Gates, coming out of retirement to contribute to free software projects.

All I can say is that I'm thankful for his considerable contributions to Mu's
code base, eagle-eyed code reviews and seemingly limitless Pythonic knowledge.

Actually, when I met Zander for the first time in July, it turned out he's a
17 year-old studying for his A-levels (the exams teenagers sit in the UK to
help them to get into university). He's doing A-levels in Maths, Physics and
Computer Science. He's third from the left in the picture below:

I want to bring your attention to how wonderful this is ~ we have several
related things going on:

* We have a courteous, knowledgable and extraordinarily competent contributor
  to Mu.
* Zander's participation is evidence that the Mu project is welcoming, safe and
  supportive enough to encourage the participation of teenage coders.
* Zander, a student who uses Mu, is helping to develop Mu. I would very much
  like to foster this sense of ownership in Mu's users, be they students,
  teachers or professional software developers.

I recently asked Zander how he got into Mu. His reply was interesting in that
he typed "micro:bit Python" into a search engine after his school had some of
the early versions of the device delivered to teachers.

He started coding with [MSWLogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSWLogo) but
has, more recently discovered Python and started making contributions to
various open source projects:

> older than you.

Right now, I feel *very very old*. :-)

How does he find working on Mu?

> with the lower years)

(When we released Mu 1.0 I made sure all of the major contributors and friends
of Mu got t-shirts to celebrate. Thanks to my hugely talented friend
[Steve Hawkes](https://twitter.com/hawkz), Zander got a t-shirt with the "Stig"
avatar shown at the top of this post.)

Zander, thank you for your continued contributions and best of luck with your
studies (he wants to go on to study Computer Science at university). I have no
doubt that wherever you end up studying will soon learn how fortunate they are
to have such a talented student as you.

:-)
