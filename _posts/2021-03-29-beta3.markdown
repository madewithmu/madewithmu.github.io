Beta 3 is here (get it from [the download page](https://codewith.mu/en/download)).

From now on we hope to maintain a fortnightly release during the beta phase as
things "come together". Shown above is our wonderful final splash screen
animation by the exceptionally talented Steve Hawkes
([@hawkz](https://github.com/hawkz)) of
[The Developer Society](https://www.dev.ngo/). Thank you so much for this
generous artistic and fun contribution to Mu.

Other changes in this release include:

* Thanks to a recent update in [PyGame Zero](https://pypi.org/project/pgzero/),
  we're back to using the official package from PyPI, rather than our patched
  fork, in the installer.
* Both Tim and Carlos have contributed updates, fixes and tests to address a
  bug affecting Windows users who may have a space in the file path upon which
  Mu is found. This was a difficult bug to reproduce but Tim did a lot of
  digging to isolate the cause with as much confidence as is possible when it
  comes to such things. Carlos did a bunch of thankless and fiddly test related
  work so testing with spaces in the path is part of our test suite. Work on
  this is ongoing so expect further improvements in upcoming releases. As
  always, many thanks for these efforts.
* Tim addressed a `wheel`/`sdist` related problem that was causing odd side
  effects with regard to dependancies.
* A strange bug, where it was not possible to install third-party packages on
  first run of Mu, opened up a deep rabbit hole of investigation. In the end
  Tim was able to fix this AND address the source of a warning message from Qt
  when Mu was starting for the first time.
* The splash screen code was rewritten in such a way that objects relating to
  the splash screen will always be garbage-collected by Python and destroyed by
  Qt5. Previously, they existed for the full duration of the application, not
  really causing any problems, but "in limbo" nonetheless.
* The crash reporting tool has had a minor update so the user is reminded to
  attach their log file to the bug report, along with an indication of where to
  find the log file.

Work is ongoing for a beta 4 release on or around 12th April. As always, we
really appreciate constructive feedback, bug reports and help.

Onwards and upwards..!
