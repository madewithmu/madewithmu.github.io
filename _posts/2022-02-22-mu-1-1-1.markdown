At last, after what feels like a huge amount of time and effort, we're
delighted to release a new stable release of Mu.

Huge thanks to the many many contributors who volunteered their time to help
make this happen. If you want to see the making of Mu unfold, check out
[this video](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/2060) (can you spot the "deliberate mistake"?):

What exactly are you looking at?

* The faces represent the developers.
* The multi-coloured blobs are the source code files that make up Mu.
* The lines between the source code blobs show how the files are organised
  together into directories.
* As time passes, developers can be seen to change, add and delete files as
  the project matures.

Kudos and thanks to Mu contributors [RPLKTR](https://rplktr.com/) for the music
and [Hawkz](https://www.dev.ngo/) for the animated logo.
