We are delighted to announce the release of Mu 1.1 alpha 2. Visit Mu's
[download page](https://codewith.mu/en/download) to get installable versions
for Windows and OSX. If you're on Linux, please run Mu from source by
following [these instructions](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html).

We're especially
proud that alpha 2 contains the largest number of updates, from the most
culturally diverse group of contributors for any release of Mu so far. This is
a healthy sign that Mu is flourishing all over the world.

A particular highlight of such community participation is the contribution of
Sean Tibor, a teacher from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A teacher contributing
code to the tools used to teach code is a wonderful sort of virtuous circle.
Well done Sean (whose [podcast](https://www.teachingpython.fm/), hosted with
his colleague Kelly, is a thing of pedagogical wonder)!

The full list of changes can be found in the
[change log](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#alpha-2) for
this release.

The most visible update is a new web mode and the "Adafruit" mode being renamed
to "CircuitPython" mode.

The web mode makes it very simple and easy to create dynamic web
applications using the [Flask web framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/). As the
screenshot below shows, users are currently able to edit Python, HTML, and CSS
files, run a local web server and view their website in their browser.

Because we want Mu to help folks succeed in making useful stuff as quickly as
possible we've bundled some default HTML templates and stylesheets along with a
simple code template which, if unchanged, will result in the following web
page:

This is, of course, in the tradition of the "it works!" default website used in
other web frameworks such as Django and Ruby on Rails.

This work is unfinished. We expect to add a "deploy" button to allow users with
the correct credentials to host their website on the cloud based infrastructure
of our friends at
[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). Expect this to appear in
alpha 3.

At the suggestion of [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/)'s own
[Dan Halbert](https://danhalbert.org/), we renamed the mode that originally
supported just Adafruit's line of boards to "CircuitPython" mode. Why? It
reflects the increasing popularity of CircuitPython with other manufacturers
whose boards use the Adafruit-led
[CircuitPython project](https://circuitpython.org/). Many thanks to
[Benjamin Shockley](http://benjaminshockley.com/) for making this happen so
smoothly.

A special mention should be made of [Tiago Montes](/mu/users/2019/05/29/tiago.html)
who was **on fire** during this past development phase, having contributed four
significant updates and bug fixes. I also want to recognise the often hidden
contributions of [Tim Golden](http://timgolden.me.uk/) and
[Carlos Pereira Atencio](https://www.embeddedlog.com/). Without these two
volunteers development on Mu would grind to a halt. Their patient, polite and
positive reviews, help, support and engagement with the Mu community are an
absolute pleasure to behold. Thank you for all you do folks!

Finally, Mu is a team effort that puts our community of users at the heart of
our development process. Many many thanks to **everyone** who has contributed
bug reports, feedback, code, documentation and onine support that has led us
to this release.

Onwards and upwards... :-)
