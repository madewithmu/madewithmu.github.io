Thanks to the efforts of volunteer teachers, young Chinese students are using
Mu to learn Python.

My Chinese friend explains,

> "I am a programmer in Hefei China, my colleagues and I give Python classes
> to more than 20 children every Tuesday afternoon. (A total of 14 weeks.)
> 
> This is a course of interest for the students who is interesting with
> programming, it's free and we are volunteers. We have a plan to teach Python,
> from the base to the high, not that high."

He goes on to explain how learning to code is making a big impression of some
of his students and their families.

> "The little boy in the [following] photo inspired me, he is very clever and

I have to admit that I was deeply moved by this explanation. I was also amazed
to see that the teachers and students use a sort of chat app for sharing and
marking homework.

It makes me extraordinarily happy to know that our collective efforts in
translating Mu for learners who don't have English as a first language are
paying off. I'd like to applaud the efforts of the volunteer teachers in China
who are helping to nurture the next generation of Python programmers. Finally,
I would like to wish their students (and parents!) the very best of luck when
learning to use Python. You are learning a skill that will help you flourish in
our modern technological world. Please keep up your efforts and, if you have
time, keep sharing what you have been doing. Perhaps, in the future, you will
speak at [PyCon China](http://cn.pycon.org).

I'm struck by how similar programming is to another passion of mine: music.
Both are cross cultural and international endeavours. By sharing our code,
learning from each other and telling stories of programming we bring our world
closer together.

My Chinese friend ends by saying,

> "Thank you for your work, Mu is so cool, Mu is best for us."

I'm so pleased you think so! Thank you!
