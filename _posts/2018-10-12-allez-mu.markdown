Check out [Girls can Code!](https://gcc.prologin.org/), programming
workshops for girls based in France. Guess what? They use Mu!

I was contacted by [Antoine Pietri](https://twitter.com/seirl_), one of the
organisers of the event, who tells me,

This is great to hear. Back in 2017 I was invited to give a
[keynote address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH6JRfP1q78) at
[PyParis](http://pyparis.org/). It proved to be a fruitful trip: not only
was the conference a wonderful experience and I made lots of new friends, but I
was able to meet French computing educators like Antoine.

This proved to be a key moment in the development of Mu as I was able to gather
feedback from users for whom English is an additional language. Our discussions
led to the following conclusion about non-English speaking learners: the
biggest barrier to learning Python isn't that its keywords are in English, but
that the tools and resources for programming in Python are.

Put simply, "je voudrais Mu en fran√ßais".

Upon my return to the UK, I immediately investigated Python's robust
capabilities in internationalisation (also known as "i18n") and this
has led to Mu being available in ten human languages (including French) with
[more on the way](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/translations.html).

I hope you'll be hearing more about Mu's use in a French speaking context
very soon. I also welcome non-English contributions to this blog too. Mu is
definitely cosmopolitan in outlook and we want to encourage and help beginner
programmers no matter their native tongue. If you have a story to tell about
how you use Mu in your own region and language, please don't hesitate to get in
touch.

Allez Mu!
