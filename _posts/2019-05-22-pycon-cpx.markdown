Friend of Mu, community hero, Tor core team member, Python core developer and
programmer extraordinaire Kushal Das,
[has blogged](https://kushaldas.in/posts/game-of-guessing-colors-using-circuitpython.html)
about the fun he's been having with Adafruit's
[Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333)
board,
[CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) and Mu.

A fortnight ago was [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/), the world's largest
gathering of Python developers in the world (around 3.5 thousand of us arrived
in Cleveland for more than a week of Python related tutorials, presentations,
keynotes, open spaces, code sprints and social events). Thanks to the
enormous generosity of [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and
[DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/) **every** attendee found a Circuit
Playground Express in their swag bag!

Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen!

At the time I was sorely tempted to blog about this amazing gift, but decided
to wait until I found evidence of any friend of mine actually using the board.
I figured that if a friend had the unprompted motivation to blog or share their
experience with the device, then it would be evidence that it was a worthy
sponsorship. After all, for every blogger there will be a large number of folks
who simply don't share what they've been up to.

Upon his return to India, Kushal (pictured above, sporting a very "Morpheus"
look) had lots of fun and, happily, his experiments
resulted in a positive educational outcome: now his young daughter (Py) wants
to have a go too..!

Kushal explains his experiment like this:

> The goal is to guess a color for the next NeoPixel on the board and then press Button A to see if you guessed right or not. Py and I are continuously playing this for the last weeks.
>
> The idea of CircuitPython, where we can connect the device to a computer and start editing code and see the changes live, is super fantastic and straightforward. It takes almost no time to start working on these, the documentation is also unambiguous and with many examples.

You can see the his code for the game in the screenshot below:

I hope you agree, such sponsorship and the ease of CircuitPython is (literally)
lighting up the lives a folks all over the world and inspiring the coders of
the future.
