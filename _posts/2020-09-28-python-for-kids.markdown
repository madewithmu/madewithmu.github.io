Friend of Mu, [Kevin Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mytechnotalent/) has
been hard at work creating free-to-use resources for kids (and older kids) who
want to learn Python, with the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org) and Mu.

Each of the ten resources tackles a different aspect of Python on the micro:bit
through illustrated "baby steps" to get you to a finished fun project. Work is
ongoing, but you can find all the links and source code [on his GitHub page for
the project](https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Python-For-Kids).

Meanwhile, in our secret fortress of solitude, the Mu "minions" (Munions..?)
have been hard at work on some fantastic updates which we hope to reveal very
soon.

Stay tuned. :-)
