Mu is a Pythonic beginner's code editor created by volunteers in the community.

It provides an easy answer to the question beginners always ask, "but how do I
start?".

Simple, <a href="https://codewith.mu/en/download">download Mu</a>.

Today, we're delighted to announce the next stable release of Mu: 1.2.0.

This release introduces Snek mode, fixes some minor bugs, addresses some usability gremlins and adjusts some capabilities to make things tidier. Much of this work was done over the summer at the code-sprints at EuroPython 2022 in Dublin. Kudos and thanks to all the new contributors to Mu.

What's new?

<li>Or friend at Adafruit, <a href="https://github.com/tannewt">@tannewt</a> made the necessary changes so Mu handles OSC commands gracefully (see the <a href="https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pull/2326">PR</a> for more details).</li>
