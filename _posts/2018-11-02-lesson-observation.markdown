I recently had the great pleasure of visiting [Wollaston School](https://www.wollastonschool.com/)
to see [Steve Foster](https://twitter.com/scipiguy) use Mu in his classroom.
Here he is in action, in perhaps the most "teacher-ish" photograph you'll see
for a long time:

This wasn't my first visit to see Steve. He very kindly allowed me to observe
his lessons back in 2017 when I was researching how learners and teachers
engage with software development tools. His was the first of several schools
and code clubs I visited for this purpose and, in addition to observing
lessons, I interviewed him and some of his colleagues. In fact, it was as a
direct result of chatting with the network administrators at Steve's school
that so much effort was put into making Mu easy to install. I was very
pleased to hear that the very same network administrators had easily managed to
install Mu on the computers in Steve's classroom.

Achievement unlocked! :-)

On this visit I observed two lessons: a year 10 GCSE class (students turn 15
during year 10, and GCSE is the examination all students take at age 16), and
a year 9 computing lesson (students turn 14 in year 9 and decide their
"options" [which GCSE courses to take] during this academic year).

Both classes were exceptionally well behaved and engaged and the students were
friendly and enthusiastic to learn. They're a credit to themselves, Steve and
their school.

I was simply introduced to the students as "Nicholas - a software developer"
and played the role of a teaching assistant. This prompted a sense
of nostalgia for me. Having students say, "Sir, I'm stuck on this problem"
made me remember my time as a secondary head of music all those years ago and
it was fun to collaborate with and support young people in their learning.
There are some aspects of teaching which are extraordinarily rewarding and a
privilege to experience -- this was one such an occasion.

The students in year 10 knew what they were up to and were already familiar
with Mu. It was good to see them use the editor with such fluency ~ to the
extent that they were concentrating on their coding problem rather than getting
side-tracked by their development environment. The first time I visited the
school, I seem to remember students using some sort of online Python tool
and I spent much of my time trying to help them fix the odd state into which
they had got themselves. I also had a great sense of satisfaction when I saw
how many of them were using the "Check" button to report potential problems
with their code. They told me they found this especially useful when they ran
their code and ended up with a syntax error. The "Check" button visually
points out the problematic line and describes the problem. Far better than
wading through terse computer-ese.

The year 9 class was especially enjoyable since I was watching their first
encounter with Mu. In the previous academic year (before Mu 1.0 was released)
they had been using IDLE as a development environment. Being able to observe
their first contact with Mu was an amazing opportunity.

I wasn't disappointed.

Steve started the lesson by introducing Mu as a new Python editor and then gave
the class a few minutes to poke around with it before asking them to report
back on what they'd discovered.

Within seconds, one of them had found the "Theme" button and toggled through to
"night" mode. This was followed by a hilarious few seconds of excited
whispering as the students all tried to turn their Mu editor into "night" mode.
Within about a minute, everyone had "night" mode enabled and the class were
feeling suitably "Hollywood hacker-ish".

Some kids found the "Check" button while others enjoyed zooming in and out to
extreme magnifications of their code. Most importantly, the feedback seemed
positive and the students enjoyed playing with Mu (yes, "playing" is perhaps
the right word).

Steve then asked them to "code along" a
[Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) script. Steve would
explain some code and demonstrate it working, then ask the kids to type it in
and check their version was working. After that, he'd repeatedly add more
features, while giving the students an opportunity to ask questions, until the
program was finished. This is exactly what Steve is doing in the photograph at
the top of this blog post.

This activity was particularly fun since the students could define their own
mysterious sounding Yes/No answers for the "magic 8 ball". In a very teenager-y
turn of events, one student cast their answers totally in the context of
resolving relationship problems. Again, Mu didn't cause any issues and the
students could simply concentrate on customising their script.

At the end of both lessons I was given 10 minutes to tell the students a little
bit about what I do as a software developer and enjoyed answering their
questions. When Steve revealed I was the creator and maintainer of Mu, the year
9 class gave me a round of applause (after one girl started clapping loudly on
her own, and then shouted to the rest of the class something along the lines
of, "Give this guy some respect won't ya..?").

After the lessons Steve and I spent some time together in an interview /
de-brief session. He provided more context about how Mu was used in his lessons
and all the feedback I have received, be it from teacher or students, will find
its way into improvements in the next version of Mu.

If you are a teacher using Mu in your classroom, please don't hesitate to
[get in touch](mailto:ntoll@ntoll.org). We'd love to hear how you're getting on
and learn about the ways we can improve your own and your students' experience
of learning to program in Python.

Thanks to Steve and his students for giving me the rewarding experience of
seeing Mu used in "real world" learning situations. Keep up the great work! :-)
