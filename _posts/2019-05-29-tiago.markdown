Mu is not a solo effort. Many folks have [contributed to Mu](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/graphs/contributors),
and I will be eternally grateful for their work. With the spirit of
recognising the voluntary contributions of others in mind, I'm going to write
about some of our most prodigious programmers. This post, the second in this
series, is about [Tiago Montes](https://tmont.es/).

I first met Tiago at
[EuroPython](https://www.europython-society.org/europython), when it was held
in Bilbao. He was a volunteer at the beginners' day and very kindly helped my
wife and youngest son take their first steps in Python (both were tagging along
at the conference while I attended talks). Since then Tiago and I have kept in
touch and, over the course of the past year, Tiago has contributed to Mu in
many different ways.

For instance, he is responsible for the Portuguese translation of the user
interface, improved and refactored the language and locale detection Mu
uses to display the user interface in the correct language, improved the
configuration of continuous integration, ensured the UI works properly with
non-ASCII characters, contributed a major rewrite of packaging setup and
requirements management and has submitted many useful bug reports.

What makes Tiago stand out is his attention to detail, formidable technical
skill, experience and knowledge and a wonderful openness to inclusive,
helpful and mutually respectful collaboration. Often, when I read a
[bug report](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/created_by/tmontes)
or
[pull request](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atmontes+is%3Aclosed)
authored by Tiago, I am struck by how clear and accessible his
writing is. Tiago very carefully describes a problem or solution in the
simplest of terms and assumes no expert knowledge on the subject in hand. He
has a knack of explaining his thought processes, suggested approaches to
addressing technical issues and how he may have had to back out of a solution
which turned out to be a cul-de-sac. This contributes a huge amount to making
Mu an easy-to-collaborate-with project: new contributors feel their lack of
knowledge is not a handicap.

His patience and willingness to hear an alternative point of view or reflect
upon an alternative solution (and perhaps change his mind as such
alternatives are explored and developed) is all done with a friendly attitude
which projects a sense of bonhomie. Once more, this helps to make Mu a
welcoming and friendly project with which folks can engage.

So, thank you Tiago for your efforts over the past year or so. Our project is
improved by your presence, work and willingness to help out. Long may this
last!

:-)
