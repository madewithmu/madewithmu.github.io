This is a bug fix release with numerous contributions from our growing
community of volunteer developers. Collectively, we've managed to fix and
improve many of the things users have been telling us about. Please see the
release notes (linked to above) for details of the fixes made.

As always, if you spot any bugs, please [don't hesitate to let us know](https://codewith.mu/en/howto/bugs).

Thanks especially to GitHub user @Linguini2004, Craig Steele, John Guan, Tiago
Montes, Tim Golden, Carlos Pereira Atencio, GitHub user @wu6692776, Eberhard
Fahle, Limor Fried, Tim McCurrach and Brent Rubell for their valuable
