If you're a mutineering mutant into playful hacking of embedded hardware with
[CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) or [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/)
then check out the new [video newsletter](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/10/25/python-on-hardware-01-adafruit-adafruit-circuitpython-micropython-python-madewithmu-thepsf/)
from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com/).

It's a quick summary of all that's been happening in the world of embedded
Python. Fun facts revealed in the show include such nuggets as the number of
pages of projects, tutorials and how-tos about CircuitPython on the Adafruit
website as well as the number of drivers for different devices compatible with
CircuitPython. The numbers quoted show the growing momentum behind Python on
embedded devices. This is good news!

It was also great to see two Mu contributors
([Radomir](https://twitter.com/deshipu) and
[Josh](https://twitter.com/all_about_code)) have their work featured. Radomir's
inventive [hardware hacking](https://www.tindie.com/stores/deshipu/) is a thing
of wonder, while Josh's work on the [EduBlocks](https://edublocks.org/) project
is, quite simply, inspiring stuff (especially when you consider he's only 14
years old!).

Finally, Limor, Phil and the wider CircuitPython team at Adafruit deserve kudos
and all sorts of accolades for their amazing work building such a welcoming,
dynamic and creative community around CircuitPython. As the project tag-line
says, "Code + Community = CircuitPython". Thank you for all the work you do!
