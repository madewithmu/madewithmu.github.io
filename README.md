**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

A simple blog for celebrating projects made with the code editor Mu.

If you'd like to contribute an article you can do so in two ways:

* **I'm not very technical**: we'd love to hear what you have to say! Please
  use the website's [submission form](https://madewith.mu/submit/). It should
  be self-explanatory, but if in doubt, please don't hesitate to ask for help
  via the email address ntoll <at> ntoll.org. We'd move mountains to help you
  and answer any questions you may have.

* **I'm a technical person**: Send a pull request containing a markdown article
  that follows the existing naming conventions found in the `_posts` directory.
  Note that graphical assets should go in the `assets` directory. If you have a
  question, just ask via the issue tracker!

We also welcome constructive criticism, ideas and feedback..!
